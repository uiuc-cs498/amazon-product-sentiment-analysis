### Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Review Data

In today’s world where online retail generates a lot of data about customers, products, sales and customer reviews on each product, sentiment analysis has become a key tool for making sense of that data. This  allows companies to get key insights into their products and has led to increased revenue. Google’s [1] definition of Sentiment Analysis is “the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.” Sentiment analysis is a rapidly emerging domain in the  field  of  Natural  Language Processing for classifying and analyzing the  human’s  sentiments, emotions and opinions  about   the   products   which   are expressed  in  the  form  of  text,  star  rating,  thumbs  up and thumbs  down. Our dataset  pertains to Amazon product reviews, which has been very useful  to customers for making informed decisions about purchasing a product in addition to helping  Amazon learn their product’s positives and negatives.
